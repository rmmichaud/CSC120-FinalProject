# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 I tried to set up the chemistt class first. I wrote most of my chemistt methods and even though I couldn't figure out how to run the program for a while, it was really helpful to have all of these functions ready once I got the game loop down. From there, I just tried working on the game loop as much as I could and trying new things and adjusting when they failed. ie, I tried a few different formats for identifying the hoods until I decided that the one I ended up choosing was the best.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 I definitely have a much better understanding of the relationships between classes after this project. I didn't fully understand that I had to create new instances of each Room, for example, in order to get the functions from Room, but once I understood that the coding went a lot more smoothly. I also finally understand why overloading methods can be helpful, as I had two rooms that only connected two one other room rather than two, so I needed a new constructor that was the same method, with only one parameter. I think a lot of things made more sense when I was making my own design choices rather than trying to fit to a really specific assignment. 

 I tried to include a timer aspect that the user could input 'stop' when the reaction was over, but was having a lot of issues with it and decided to just make the ending a random result (because sometimes that is how reactions are in real life). 

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
You can move between labs no matter what hood you are at, and I think I maybe would have changed that to make the game more challenging and more mapped out.

I think organization in general was an issue for me and I would've liked to organize my code better, but that is more on the back end and doesn't really affect how the game is played. 
 

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 I want to include a feature for chemists where you are given the entire inventory and then you have to figure out a reaction based on what is available. These reactions I included are really common organic chemistry reactions so I think it would be fun to see if chemists could get it. 

 I think if I had more time/didn't have a bunch of other finals to work on then I would have tried to make the timer work with input. 

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 A lot of people at demo day were having issues with how much information they were receiving each round, so I adjusted the output to make it more user-friedly. I've never designed a text-based game before so it was definitely helpful to see how people were reacting to it. 

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
I think I would recommend to write more things out before I started working to get a better sense of what I want each class to do. I mostly figured that out as I went, but I think writing it out and maybe talking to someone else in the class would have been helpful for getting a better grounding before I started coding.
