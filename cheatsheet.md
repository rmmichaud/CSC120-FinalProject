This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.
LEVEL ONE: grab, go, drop, exit, help, yes, no (in reference to specific, clear prompt).

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.
On the second level, the user needs to 'set up round bottom flask' before adding items, and 'measure' with syringe before adding chemicals.
